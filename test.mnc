Does this still work? :/
decs {
	int: a, b, c;
	float: t;
	cheese: y,z;
}

shout "A should equal 11:";

b = 9;
c = 2;

// a = b + c;

a = 10;

shout "A:", a;

if (a < b)
	shout "A is smaller";
end
if (a > b)
	shout "A is larger";
end
if (a == b)
	shout "A is equal to b";
end
if (a != b)
	shout "A is not equal to b";
end
